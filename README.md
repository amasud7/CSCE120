Program Design and Concepts

This course builds on existing programming knowledge, focusing on problem-solving with C++. 
It emphasizes computational thinking, program analysis, design, and implementation. 
Students will use basic and aggregate data types to create functional and object-oriented solutions, 
develop classes with dynamic memory management, and employ error handling strategies to enhance program security and robustness.
